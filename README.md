# Student Administrative App

## Overview

This is a simple JSON based REST API, built with Node, Express. It uses MySql database as backend.


## Setup
* What is needed to make the repo run once downloaded?

Clone the repo and install dependencies via NPM:

	npm install

By default, the app looks for a MySQL database on localhost called 'studentadministration'. This can be changed in the db/db_config.js file, by editing the credentials. The default 'root' and '<password>' are supplied as placeholders for the logins, you will need to update these to your localhost database credentials.

Run schema in StudentAdministration_schema.sql, then it will create 'studentadministration' database and its related tables
